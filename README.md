Optimised automatic reassignment of taxonomic classifications for 10,000 genebank Capsicum accessions. Uses a new method suitable for the assignment / correction of genebank genomic datasets. The method is implemented here on the G2P Sol pepper dataset, using data available at DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7016070.
